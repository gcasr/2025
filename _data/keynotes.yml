  abstract: "Scientific applications are increasingly critical to the economic, military, and environmental health of the nation.   Are they vulnerable to attack?  Are they vulnerable in novel ways compared to typical software?    I will describe my group’s work that addresses these questions through user studies, fuzzing, and introspection and virtualization of floating point arithmetic.    A recent effort found numerous vulnerabilities in several applications that leave them open to “classical” attacks such as code injection and return-oriented programming.  Another effort found a proof-of-concept for a novel form of attack we call “chaos control”.  Our results, and those of others, suggest that the answers to both questions is yes.  "
