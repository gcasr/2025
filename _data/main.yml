  IEEE eScience 20XX brings together leading interdisciplinary research 
  communities, developers and users of eScience applications and enabling IT 
  technologies. The objective of the eScience Conference is to promote and 
  encourage all aspects of eScience and its associated technologies, applications, 
  algorithms and tools with a strong focus on practical solutions and challenges. 
  eScience 20XX interprets eScience in its broadest meaning that enables and improves 
  innovation in data- and compute-intensive research across all domain sciences 
  ranging from traditional areas in physics and earth sciences to more recent 
  fields such as social sciences, arts and humanities, and artificial intelligence 
  for a wide variety of target architectures including HPC, cloud and IoT 
  infrastructures.
